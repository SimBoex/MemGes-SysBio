# Introduction

The use of biometrics to solve the authentication problem is becoming increasingly widespread. The techniques used are based on a physical or behavioral characteristic that a user possesses for a period of time. In particular, their use could make authentication much simpler, especially when applied to mobile devices like smartphones. In fact, our smartphones possess a multitude of sensors that can be used for biometric authentication.

# Internship

The internship is divided into two parts: the first part focuses on the creation of a MemGes application for the phone that allows the acquisition of gestures by users. The second part focuses on the creation of tests that demonstrate the validity of two algorithms that can be used for user authentication. The algorithms we are going to test are: the traditional DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) and an algorithm based on a particular fuzzy function. In the final part, we will show the results obtained, highlighting the observations that can be deduced.
